# Supernova
The goal is to develop a small game engine that can render 2D and 3D scenes using Vulkan. This also includes systems for glTF scenes, physics, entities, and input.

The renderer is based on [Vulkan C++ examples and demos](https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan) by Sascha Willems.

Currently using Vulkan [1.3](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#versions-1.3) with [Dynamic Rendering](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#_render_pass_objects_deprecation_via_dynamic_rendering).

Visual Studio 2022 is supported, but CMake support will be added soon.
