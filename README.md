# Supernova
The goal is to develop a small game engine that can render 2D and 3D scenes using Vulkan. This also includes systems for glTF scenes, physics, entities, and input.

The renderer is based on [Vulkan C++ examples and demos](https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan) by Sascha Willems.

Currently using Vulkan 1.3 with [Dynamic Rendering](https://docs.vulkan.org/samples/latest/samples/extensions/dynamic_rendering/README.html) (VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering).

Visual Studio 2022 is supported, but CMake support will be added soon.
